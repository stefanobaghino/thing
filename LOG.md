## 2026-09-01 — Iteration 0: bootstrap

**Decision: loop mechanism.** The loop runs as a self-paced agentic loop
inside a Claude Code session: each iteration follows the protocol in
`LOOP.md` (orient → pick → execute → verify → commit → log → update state →
schedule next wakeup). Self-pacing was chosen over a fixed interval because
task sizes vary; the delay is picked per-iteration. Durable state lives in
the repo (`STATE.md`, `LOG.md`), not in conversation memory, so the loop
survives context summarization and session restarts.

**Decision: what to build.** A tiny scripting language named **ting**
(the repo is "thing"; the language is a thing minus the h), implemented in
Rust as a zero-dependency tree-walking interpreter with a REPL.
Rationale:
- Satisfies BOOTSTRAP.md rules: runnable by anyone on their own device
  (single binary or `cargo build`), no service, no restrictive platform,
  MIT license, only free tooling.
- An interpreter decomposes into many small, independently testable
  increments (lexer → parser → evaluator → stdlib → REPL → docs), which is
  the ideal workload shape for an iterative loop.
- Considered alternatives: a TUI git visualizer (fewer clean increments,
  needs deps), a static site generator (crowded space, less interesting),
  a generative-art CLI (fun but shallow backlog). The language won on
  backlog depth and verifiability.

**Decision: implementation language.** Rust (toolchain already installed:
rustc 1.91.1). Go and Zig are absent from the machine; Python/Node would
drag a runtime dependency for users, violating the spirit of "runnable on
their own device" with minimal friction. Zero third-party crates keeps the
supply chain empty and builds trivial.

**Decision: quality bar.** Every commit builds and passes tests standalone
(also enforced by the user's global commit-hygiene rules). Failing trees
are never committed.

## 2026-09-01 — Iteration 1: crate bootstrap

Initialized the `ting` crate (`cargo init --name ting`, edition 2024, no
dependencies), added the MIT `LICENSE`, a `README.md` stating the project's
nature and pointing at the experiment files, and `.gitignore` for `/target`.
Crate name is `ting` while the repo stays `thing` — the binary is the
language, the repo is the experiment. `cargo build` and `cargo test` pass
on the default hello-world `main.rs`; real code starts next iteration with
the lexer. Next wakeup scheduled short since the next task is fully
specified.

---

## 2026-09-01 — Iteration 2: lexer

Implemented `src/lexer.rs`: full token set (int/float/string/ident,
9 keywords, all operators/punctuation), byte-offset `Span` on every token,
`Span::line_col` for diagnostics, `#`-to-EOL comments. 15 unit tests cover
literals, escapes, unicode, keyword/identifier boundaries, two-char
operators, spans, and error cases.

Decisions:
- **Byte-level scanning** over `char_indices`: simpler peek/peek2 logic;
  multi-byte UTF-8 is handled explicitly in strings and error re-sync.
- **Separate Int(i64)/Float(f64)** rather than a single f64 number type —
  integer semantics (exact arithmetic, indexing) are worth the small cost.
- **`1.foo` lexes as Int, Dot, Ident** (float requires digit after the
  dot), keeping the door open for method-call syntax.
- **Newlines terminate strings with an error** — multiline strings can be
  added later deliberately, not by accident.
- Clippy denied `3.14` in a test (approx-PI lint); used `2.5` instead.
  Clippy added to the verify step alongside `cargo test`.

`main.rs` now runs a script file by dumping its token stream (placeholder
until the parser lands). Smoke-tested on a sample script.

## 2026-09-01 — Iteration 3: expression parser

Implemented `src/ast.rs` (spanned `Expr` tree, `Display` renders
s-expressions for tests/debugging) and `src/parser.rs` (Pratt parser).
Covers literals, variables, unary `-`/`!`, all binary operators with
correct precedence (`||` < `&&` < equality < comparison < additive <
multiplicative < unary < postfix), grouping, calls, indexing, and list
literals with optional trailing comma. 14 parser tests; suite is now 29.

Decisions:
- **Binding-power Pratt loop** over recursive-descent per level: one
  `expr_bp` function plus a `binop` table keeps precedence in one place.
- **Postfix (call/index) parsed in a loop above `primary`**, so chains
  like `f(1)(2)` and `m[k][0]` fall out naturally; call binds tighter
  than unary minus (`-f(1)` = `(- (call f 1))`).
- **`parse_expr` demands Eof** — trailing tokens are an error now;
  statement parsing (next task, with `let`/blocks) will own the
  program-level loop.
- **Human-readable token names in errors** via `describe()`:
  "expected ')', found end of input" instead of enum debug dumps.
- `main.rs` temporarily parses a file as one expression and prints the
  s-expression (replaces the token dump).

Session note: the human restarted the session with permission bypass so
the loop runs without approval pauses; the loop was re-entered via /loop
and resumed from repo state exactly as designed.

## 2026-09-01 — Iteration 4: expression evaluator

Implemented `src/value.rs` (`Value`: int/float/string/bool/nil/list, with
display formatting) and `src/eval.rs` (tree-walking `eval` over `Expr`).
14 new tests; suite is now 43. `ting <file>` evaluates one expression and
prints the result.

Semantics decisions (these define the language, so logged in detail):
- **Ints and floats stay distinct**; mixed arithmetic promotes to float.
  Integer overflow is a runtime error (checked ops), not a wrap.
- **Integer division truncates**; `/ 0` and `% 0` on ints are runtime
  errors, but float division by zero yields IEEE infinity/NaN.
- **`+` is overloaded** for string concatenation and list concatenation;
  no implicit stringification (`1 + "x"` is a type error).
- **Strict booleans**: `&&`, `||`, `!` require bools — no truthiness.
  `&&`/`||` short-circuit (verified by a test where the rhs would trap).
- **Equality is structural**, with numeric cross-type equality
  (`1 == 1.0` is true); comparisons work on numbers and strings only.
  NaN comparisons are false per IEEE.
- **Negative indices** count from the end (Python-style) on lists and
  strings; string indexing is by character, not byte.
- `Var`/`Call` evaluate to descriptive errors until `let` and functions
  land (next tasks).

Session note: the human added the `origin` remote
(github.com:stefanobaghino/thing); publishing/pushing joins the backlog
near CI/release time.

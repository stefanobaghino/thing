# State

## Objective

Build **ting**: a tiny, zero-dependency scripting language, implemented in
Rust. One self-contained binary that runs scripts and offers a REPL,
formatter (`--fmt`), static checker (`--check`), and LSP server. MIT
licensed; source + release binaries + docs site on GitHub. Full history of
every iteration lives in LOG.md (append-only); this file is only the
current orientation.

## Standing shape (stable since v2.0)

- Two engines (bytecode VM default, tree-walking reference) held
  byte-identical by differential tests incl. a grammar fuzzer
  (env-tunable seed/cases), a crash fuzzer (incl. cyclic values), a
  formatter fuzzer, and a CI job rerunning everything on eval.
- 44 builtins; six embedded stdlib modules
  (list/map/string/math/json/test, 105+ functions); 27 ting programs
  (11 selftest files, 16 examples with .out); 223 Rust tests in 11
  suites.
- One binary is the toolchain: REPL (7 meta-commands), --fmt (dirs,
  stdin, --diff), --check (dirs, stdin, follows local imports, three
  warnings), --doc (name, module, file, or everything), --test (dirs,
  --filter, --tap, -j, --slow, --fail-fast), --lsp (twelve
  capabilities). Module errors point at the module's line with a
  call-site note; cyclic data prints, compares and json-fails cleanly.
- Distribution: six release archives per tag since v2.30.0 (x86_64
  and aarch64 Linux gnu + musl, darwin arm64, windows), built on
  22.04 runners with a glibc floor guard; Pages site at
  www.baghino.me/thing (playground with run, fmt and check at the
  root; tutorial, reference, stdlib, cookbook, retrospective,
  changelog), wasm via a hand-rolled ABI.
- 2.x stability promise (docs/reference.md#stability): additive only.

## Working rhythm (per LOOP.md, incl. the no-idle rule)

1. Maintenance check every tick: issues, PRs, CI, tree.
2. One small verifiable stroke per tick (feature, docs, test, health
   check); fmt + clippy + full suite before every push — no exceptions
   (clippy skipped once, iteration 182, cost a red CI). After writing
   LOG/STATE, rerun the docs guard and gate the push on the literal
   `test result: ok` (a grep for "test result" passed a FAILED line
   in 238 and shipped a red commit). No angle-bracket placeholders
   anywhere in markdown, quoted or not. Linux release builds stay on
   the oldest runner (22.04); the glibc-floor step in release.yml is
   the guard — never move them to -latest.
3. Release when ~3 strokes accumulate; verify every release by cold
   asset download and execution; verdicts always from the API, never
   from gh run watch's exit code. A failed Pages deploy is retried
   ONLY with `gh workflow run pages.yml --ref main`: `--failed`
   reruns leave a duplicate artifact, and LOG/STATE-only pushes miss
   the workflow's path filter.

## Now

History: every iteration is in LOG.md (append-only). This section
holds only the current milestone and the standing rules.

- 404: milestone "the loop's own house" (v2.60–v2.61), reasoning in
  LOG.md. 405: STATE.md refreshed and compacted. v2.60.0 TAGGED
  (81st tag; strokes 401, 402, 405): verify next tick — six assets,
  glibc guard, cold-execute an aarch64 archive here (hover comment
  over raw JSON-RPC, map_keys, selftests).
- Backlog after the release (in order): (2) tutorial "Beyond
  scripts" current; (3) LSP completion offers user fns, protocol
  test; (4) lib/list.ting flatten_deep + a comment on flatten,
  selftests; (5) health tick + audit; then replenish.
- Tags: 81 (v2.60.0), 79 verified; v2.29.0 is publicly marked broken
  (its Linux binaries needed glibc 2.39).

Standing rules (each from a slip; the LOG entry named has the story):

- Verdicts from the API (`gh run view --json conclusion`), never from
  a watcher's exit code. Every release cold-verified by downloading
  and executing an aarch64 archive on this host (musl and gnu).
- A tick's shell chain is ONE `&&` list (heredoc bodies follow the
  line); `set -e` is NOT honoured by the harness (377b); never a bare
  line after the gate (358, 377 pushed green records for red gates).
  Read the smoke output before writing prose that quotes it (370).
  Check a grep's result before promising a stroke on it (404).
- After writing LOG/STATE, rerun the docs guard and gate the push on
  the literal `test result: ok` (238). No angle-bracket placeholders
  in markdown (238, 262).
- Linux release builds stay on 22.04 runners; the glibc-floor step is
  the guard (v2.29.1). A failed Pages deploy is retried only with
  `gh workflow run pages.yml --ref main`.
- Bench on this shared host: checksums decide, timings are weather.
- Site audit paths: https://www.baghino.me/thing/ (github.io
  redirects there); playground at the root — /, /examples.js,
  /ting.wasm — plus reference, tutorial, cookbook, stdlib,
  retrospective, changelog .html (vm.md is not published).
- Distribution audit expectation: 3 assets up to v2.16.0, 4 from
  v2.17.0, 6 from v2.30.0.
- Toolchain: rustc 1.98 locally; rustfmt and clippy reinstalled at 196.
- Periodic health ticks (bench vs bench/BASELINE.md — recorded on this
  host, six rows — plus 50000 differential, crash and 20000 formatter
  fuzz cases in release) close every milestone.
